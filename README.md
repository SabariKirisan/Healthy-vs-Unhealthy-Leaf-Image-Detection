# Anthracnose Disease Analysis Using Deep Learning

This project focuses on detecting **Anthracnose disease** in plant leaves using a deep learning approach. It employs **InceptionV3**, a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), for binary image classification‚Äîdistinguishing between **healthy** and **unhealthy (anthracnose-infected)** leaves. The workflow includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, visualization, and export to TensorFlow Lite for deployment.
